# Air-Quality-Index-Dashboard
🌏 Air Quality Index (AQI) Dashboard – Major Cities of India  An interactive Power BI dashboard that visualizes the Air Quality Index (AQI) across major Indian cities. This project explores pollution levels, key pollutant metrics, and even includes a future trend prediction to understand how air quality might evolve in the coming years.

📌 Project Overview
This dashboard provides a deep look into India’s air quality landscape — comparing cities, pollutant concentrations, and identifying both the most and least polluted regions. It combines data storytelling and analytics to make environmental data easy to understand and visually engaging.

🧹 Data Preparation
•	Raw AQI data for multiple Indian cities was cleaned and transformed in Power BI.
•	Duplicates were removed, missing values handled, and city names standardized.
•	Additional calculations were made to project future AQI trends based on past data patterns.

📊 Dashboard Insights
🔹 AQI Trend Overview (Top-Left)
Displays how air quality has changed over time, with a future prediction extending beyond the current year.
You can easily observe the rise and fall of AQI over the years — giving a glimpse into how pollution might behave if current conditions persist.
🔹 AQI by City Overview (Top-Center)
A bar chart ranking cities by total AQI levels.
It highlights cities with critical pollution levels like Delhi and Patna while contrasting them with cleaner cities such as Shillong or Ernakulam.
🔹 Pollutant Concentration Cards (Top-Right)
Quick stats for key pollutants:
•	CO (Carbon Monoxide)
•	NO (Nitric Oxide)
•	PM 2.5
•	Toluene
These cards summarize the intensity of each pollutant — a snapshot of what drives overall AQI variations.
🔹 Areawise AQI Map (Center)
An interactive map visualization plotting AQI distribution across Indian cities.
Larger and darker circles indicate higher pollution levels, helping you see the hotspots of poor air quality in an instant.
🔹 Top 5 Least Polluted Cities (Bottom-Left)
A colorful treemap showing which cities maintain the cleanest air — cities like Coimbatore, Ernakulam, and Shillong stand out as top performers.
🔹 Top 5 Most Polluted Cities (Bottom-Right)
Another treemap highlighting cities with alarmingly high AQI levels.
It visually contrasts the extremes — reminding us how diverse India’s environmental conditions are across regions.

🔮 Future Scope
•	Integrate real-time AQI data APIs for live monitoring.
•	Use time-series forecasting models (ARIMA / Prophet) to improve future AQI predictions.
•	Add correlation analysis to compare AQI trends with industrial growth or traffic data.
